# AIMaze

Final Project of the Artificial Intelligence course of University

Problem description: 
Consider a 20*20 maze. Agent located at (1,1) as the starting point. (4,7) and (16,16) assumed to have two bonuses. 
Randomly put 60 walls and 20 holes in this maze. 
The agent can not pass through the walls and if it falls where a hole is located, it will get 10 negative points. 
The goal is to reach 2 bonuses in the shortest path.

Maze generator implemented using java
MazeSolver implemented using python
